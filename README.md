# README file for C++ programming project

This is an initial git repository for your programming project.
It contains an initial directory structure that we wish you could
use as follows:

  * `src/` -- Contains source files

  * `Resources` -- Contains textures, sounds, fonts and map structure

How to run the game and additional information:

  * `run.sh` & `compile.sh` -- Compiles the game. executable (rpg) is created into the build folder. `run.sh` runs this file automatically.
  
  * The game currently only works on linux operating systems (WSL does not work).

  * If you have problems with crashing, disable MUSIC_ON variable in common.hpp file.

  * Sounds may cause crashing if you have any other sound playing

  * game uses SFML library and cmake for compiling, make sure you have those installed.
